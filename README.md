+ **Reboot** your machine

# Configuration
The purpose of the example configuration sandbox.wsb is to open suspicious files in a safe environment. Therefore the sandbox has no internet connectivity and mounts the folder under C:\sandbox from the Host-System in Read-Only mode. Obviously you have to create this folder before you start the sandbox.
